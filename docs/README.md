This website showcases the pillars forming the new concept launched by Pep Torres, BOUNDLESS.
The future of streaming is now, and this website gives you a full overview on what the service consists of and 
how it is executed, as well as media elements as an example of the service itself.
This website is mobile-first design and it's fully responsive and accessible on a vast range of devices, making it easy to navigate for all kinds of users.
 
## User Experience (UX)

#### Research

BOUNDLESS new concept doesn't have any direct competition on the web. It's concept is dense,
therefore the goal will be to introduce this new concept to the generic public by condensing the
information in a visible and descriptive way, to help users to get familiar with the concept in the first visit.
In the future, this website could develop in a B2B (Business-to-Business) concept. However, at first we will take a B2C (Business-to-Customer) approach,
focusing on the emotional triggers such as branding and the ease of readability.

#### Business Goals

Present BOUNDLESS new concept to the users.
Present the website on a user-friendly form, where information can be absorbed easily.
